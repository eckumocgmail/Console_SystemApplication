I want to implement a super technology, which is designed to search for especially dangerous criminal gangs. The main idea is the application of simulation techniques 2 systems opposing each other. To build the creation of the model, you need to use. synthesis techniques 
f (x) = p1 * f1 (x) + p2 * f2 (x) + .... + pn * fn (x);
f (x) - Returns the geolocation of the next crime scene.
=================
f1 (x) = p1 * f (x),
f2 (x) = p1 * f (x),
..... = ..........
fn (x) = pn * f (x)
=================
p (1..n) - the probability of a change in behavior depending on the value of the indicator (f1..fn), for example, it can be the air temperature or the volume of financial. funds received to a personal account.
==================================

Suppose that any information gradually becomes available, in the conditions of industrial operation of the integration system.

====================================

The model simulates the interaction of 2 systems:
- detection system
-invasion system-
 responsible for testing hypotheses and recording results as:
     - information entered into the limiting factors for the research object, for example:
    Example:
       The detection system is assigned a task to restrict communication with respect to the object under study.
     If the object performs image transmission, the intrusion system sets the task of intercepting, blocking, generating interference that interferes with the operation of the radio frequency communication device.
=================


   Thus, the group of experts draws up a plan of joint tactical actions of operational groups of law enforcement agencies, communication devices (repeaters, sources of information transmission, and the use of criminal acts).
    As a result of the lack of results, the system automatically generates the following hypothesis:


  r (x) = p1 * k1 * hr (x) + p2 * k2 * dr (x);
  r (x) -result of work inf. system for a given period of time.
 p1, p2 - the probability obtained as a result of the exploitation of the learning technology.

for example:
   conducted 100 experiments,
       in 70 of them the technical receiver did not give a result,
     and at 30 a law enforcement officer 'fell asleep' =)lo
